# Embed Builder

The embed builder feature allows you to create an embed with content of your choosing, as Discord users are unable to do this, and are not allowed to work around this as stated by [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-).

> **Note**
>
> Anitra requires the `Embed Links` permission to do this. 
>
> Anitra also requires the `Send Messages` permission in the channel where the embed should be posted

## Setup

Firstly run `/embed build`. This will return buttons that will give you a form that you can fill in with the content you want.

An example of a finished embed:

| Title       | The big text at the top of the embed.                                                    |
| Author      | Works like a title, except this allows you to add an icon/avatar next to it.             |

| Fields      | Work like descriptions, except this allows to give headings (name) to your text (value). |
| Image       | The larger image at the bottom of the embed, usually used for embeds.                    |
| Thumbnail   | The smaller image on the top right of the embed.                                         |
