# Self-Claimable Button Roles

The Button Roles (or Self-Claimable Roles) feature allows server members to get roles that **you** (as an administrator) allow to be claimable.

> **Note**
>
> Anitra requires the `Manage Roles` permission for this to work.
>
> Anitra also needs to be above the roles you would like to add to the Button Roles feature.
