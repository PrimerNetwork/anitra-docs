# Private Rooms

This feature allows server members to have their own personal voice channels, which they can of course add people into.

> **Note**
>
> Anitra requires the `Move Members` and `Manage Channels` permissions to do this.

## Example

If we were to run `/rooms setup` as an administrator, it will create a voice channel named `Create Private Room`, unless you provide a name for it. Yes, it is customisable :)

Now, whenever someone joins that voice channel, a new one shall be created with the following format for the room's name: `{member}'s room` (Example: `Sham's room`). Which they can add people to if they would like.
